# Utilities (Subsystem of AIMA Code)



The **utilities** system provides a set of basic functions, macros,
and data types that are used throughout the other systems.  For
example, we define the `while` and `for` iteration
macros, the two-dimensional `point` (and operations on it), the `queue`
and binary `tree` types, and some debugging and testing code.
